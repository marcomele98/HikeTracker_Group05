TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 5)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done : (4, 4)
- Total points committed vs. done : (27, 27)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) : (72h , 73h 55m)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics
0) Database creation, project setup, collecting data, learning task and scrum meetings
1) Browse hikes - As a visitor I want to see the list (with filtering) of available hikes so that I can get information on them
2) Describe hikes - As a local guide I want to add a hike description so that users can look at it
3) Register - As a visitor I want to register to the platform so that I can use its advanced services
4) See hikes' details - As a hiker want to see the full list of hikes so that I can get information (including tracks) on them


| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 0      | 8       |  -     |  27h       |   29h 10m    |
| 1      | 6       |  3     |  8h 30m    |   9h 50m     |
| 2      | 9       |  8     |  13h 30m   |   19h 25m    |
| 3      | 6       |  3     |  10h       |   11h 30m    |
| 4      | 6       |  13    |  13h 30m   |   4h         |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimated task average: (72h/35) = 2h 3m 
  - Actual task average: (73h 55m/35) = 2h 6m
  - Estimated standard deviation: 2.12
  - Actual standard deviation: 2.33
  
  <br>
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: (0,974 - 1) = -0.026

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 9h
  - Total hours spent: 9h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 11 
  - Coverage: around 80%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 10h 
  - Total hours spent: 8h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 1h 55m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  We didn't know how to do anything related to the map, so we reserved a lot of time to that story; but then we realized that story 1 overlapped a lot with story 4, so we used the time that we didn't need in story 4 to better implement the other stories.
  <br>
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  We have to spend more time on better understanding the stories before starting estimating and working on them.
  On the other hand, we really understood the power of good communication on improving everyone's job.
  <br>

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  <br>

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  <br>

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  Define internal delivery dates in order to have a better organization of the work.
  <br>
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  Everyone gave 100% of himself/herself to the team and we improved as singles and as a team during this sprint.
  Each of us is always ready to help the other members.
